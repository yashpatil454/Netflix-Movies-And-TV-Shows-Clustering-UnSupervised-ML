<h2> :floppy_disk: Problem Statement and Project Description</h2>
<p>Netflix Movies And TV Shows Clustering dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.</p>

<h2> :book: Goal:</h2>

Our goal here is to use clustering algorithms in machine learning and data analysis to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. This technique can be applied to Netflix's movies and TV shows to categorize them into groups based on their genre, popularity, audience, etc.

This information can be used by Netflix to make recommendations to its users, improve its content offerings, and increase engagement and customer satisfaction

<h2> :chart_with_upwards_trend: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Exploratory Data Analysis concluded that TV-MA is the highest rated series with 2861, which means it is intended for mature audiences only and contains content that may not be suitable for children. Netflix has a greater number of movies than TV shows, with 69.14% movies and 30.86% TV shows.
Raúl Campos and Jan Suter have directed the highest number of films i.e. 18 films.
USA has highest number of Films and TV-shows, but in India Films are made on a large scale as compared to TV-shows
Production of movies started mainly started from 2000's and many more key findings.<p>

 <h2> :book: K-Means Clustering</h2>

<p>K-Means Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning in machine learning, used for cluster analysis. It partitions data into K number of clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm iteratively updates the mean values and the cluster assignments, until the cluster means no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
